            <p><b><i>Task Info:</i></b> I'm studying the differences between <b>good/helpful
              advice</b> and <b>bad advice</b>. You'll be given a <b>question</b> that someone has sought
              help about, as well as two pieces of possible advice (<b>A</b> and <b>B</b>). The question is often
              lengthy! Your task is
              to choose which advice is better, then justify your decision.
            </p>

            <p>Good advice is <b>helpful</b> from the point of view of the question-writer. It should refer to the exact
              same <b>situation</b> that they've described, without getting any of the details wrong. The question-asker
              should be able to understand the advice, trust it, and (hopefully!) use it to gain a better perspective on
              their situation. If followed, it should make their situation better.</p>

            <b><i>Guidelines:</i></b>
            <ul>
              <li>First, choose which advice is better. There are four choices: <span class="bg-primary text-white"><b>Definitely</b></span>
                A/B
                and <span class="bg-info text-white"><b>Slightly</b></span> A/B.
                <ul>
                  <li>Please trust your instincts and choose <span
                      class="bg-primary text-white"><b>Definitely</b></span> if
                    you would feel more
                    confident giving one advice, versus the other one.
                  </li>
                  <li>Try to focus on quality over quantity. Helpful advice doesn't need to solve <i>everything</i>.
                    Similarly, unhelpful advice can often be lengthy!
                  </li>
                  <li>Please do the best you can, given what you know about the world and the situation the
                    question-asker is in.
                  </li>
                </ul>

              </li>
              <li>Second, please rate the helpfulness of the worse piece of advice: either <span
                  class="bg-success text-white">Slightly helpful</span>, <span class="bg-warning">Not helpful</span>, or
                <span class="bg-danger text-white">Dangerous</span>.
                <ul>
                  <li>Please look carefully at the details of each piece of advice. If a piece of seemingly-reasonable
                    advice seems to misunderstand or misrepresent details in the post, but doesn't suggest anything
                    harmful, then mark it <span class="bg-warning">Not helpful</span>.
                  </li>
                  <li>If a piece of advice gets the details right - but maybe is a bit generic, or weird - then pick
                    <span class="bg-success text-white">Slightly helpful</span>.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Third (and last), you'll be asked a multiple choice question depending on your answer to Question 2.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <b><i>Miscellaneous:</i></b>
            <ul>
              <li>Warning: many questions use foul language or describe sexual or lewd situations.</li>
              <li>I'm still getting started with these HITs and want to pay workers fairly for them
                (>$15/hour). From doing some of these, I've found that answering the questions is pretty
                fast, but reading the question can take a while. Your mileage may vary, just make sure
                you thoroughly read the question, since often the advice-writers didn't! Please bear with
                me while I figure out a good rate for these.

My GF's older sister has never lived with us, and is always in legal trouble (theft, drugs). Lately the local Sheriff's department has been coming by our place looking for her. We have told them that she doesn't and never has lived here and that we are not in contact with her. The Sheriff told us that our address is the address listed on her driver's licence. I called the local city police department about it as maybe false identity or something and they said that the only thing we can do is call the DMV and talk to them about it. But when calling the DMV they say that that is private information and can't discuss it with us. That they only discuss it with the older sister, who won't change it as she is obviously using it to evade the police. Is there anything else we can do to get this taken off her driver's licence? It's incredibly annoying hearing a knock on the door and wondering if its the police looking for her. Also I am concerned if she can use our address to steal our mail or other things as she has also been arrested many times for Identity Theft.</p></div><div class="row"><div class="col-xl-6"><div class="panel"><h6><i>Advice A</i></h6><p>You don't know where she is do you?</p><p>One thing you need to do is personally go into the Sheriffs office and talk to somebody higher up. They may believe that you don't know where she is or they may not. I don't have much advice to offer but one thing I can advise is you need to get proactive as you can. Because if they decide that you're covering for her or something, there is a very good chance your door is going to get kicked in at 2 am some night.</p></div></div><div class="col-xl-6"><div class="panel"><h6><i>Advice B</i></h6><p>I'm pretty sure the cops are right. She's using it to evade the police. She is committing criminal acts. Your best course of action would be to inform the police that she's committing crimes and that you're concerned for her safety. They should be able to remove the address. If she's committing crimes while living with you, she's probably breaking some law as well. In most cases (though not all) the cops will remove her if you call them and explain the situation.</p></div></div></div><div class="answerrowex"><div class="panel"><h6>1. Which piece of advice is better (more helpful <i>overall</i>)? <label class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Definitely A</label></h6> <p>Advice A is helpful, while also showing understanding of the key details (the Sheriff's dept likely believed that the question-asker knew where the GF's older sister lived.)</p></div><div class="panel"><h6>2.

It suggests that the question-asker contact the police (even though they already did!) However, contacting the police again shouldn’t be harmful, just a waste of time. Also, it says “the cops will remove her if you call them…” but the key problem is that the GF’s older sister DOESN’T live in the GF’s house.</p></div><div class="panel"><h6>3.

We talk about our future all the time- marriage, babies, property, etc. but he keeps making excuses as to why he isn’t ready for any of that yet. We both make good money, yet he says he isn’t financially ready to buy a house or a ring. I know that isn’t true, he makes more than I do and I make $200k/yr. He also has two motorcycles and a snowmobile which seem to be where he puts most of his money- and we’re still renting. When I call him out on it he then turns to other excuses and makes me feel like I’m on trial in our relationship - saying things like “think about that fight we had a few months ago, it’s probably not a good time to get engaged right now”. (Note that most of our arguments are around him not committing and me feeling insecure in our relationship, no other big issues going on). I don’t necessarily need a ring and marriage right now, I’m happy being with him- but I’m 32 and we want kids- so I would like any sort of step that reassures me he’s committed and it will eventually happen. I’ve told him even opening a joint savings account together would be a step in the right direction, but he then says things like “okay we can start putting the money we spend on trips and going out to eat into a savings”. He makes more than me and I don’t have to sacrifice those things in order to save. I’m starting to get really frustrated and told him I don’t want to be a long term gf, and that I don’t want to be with someone that isn’t sure they want to be with me. I try to bring it up in a non aggressive calm way, but he always gets frustrated and turns it into an argument that I know will set us back even more- because it seems like if we have any fight the clock resets and he will use that as a reason to not get engaged. My biggest fear is that he will never commit and I’ll end up 40 and alone. Should I leave?</p></div><div class="row"><div class="col-xl-6"><div class="panel"><h6><i>Advice A</i></h6><p>Sounds like he has different priorities and has cold feet, really you can't do anything about it if he isn't mentally ready. The trial thing is strange though and he's probably complacent with how things are</p></div></div><div class="col-xl-6"><div class="panel"><h6><i>Advice B</i></h6><p>I would end it if this isn't something you can move past. The guy is 31 with a snowmobile and 2 motorcycles. He needs to figure things out. Is it financial? The kids?

Which piece of advice is better (more helpful <i>overall</i>)? <label class="btn btn-info btn-sm">Slightly A</label></h6> <p>Advice B is reasonable, but it also feels a bit fishy - as if the writer didn’t fully understand the situation. In particular, it seems to suggest that the couple has kids (as the advice refers to ‘the kids’) though it’s possible that’s a typo. </p></div><div class="panel"><h6>2.

There were no fire extinguishers or escape plans. The machinery was extremely old (1970s and older) without any safety guards. One of the machines repeatedly caught FIRE during use when paper would get stuck inside. To fix it, we had to insert a metal prong inside the machine to remove the paper. There were multiple chemicals (ink, IPA, lubricants) left sitting open. There are multiple electrical outlets that are exposed that spark and occasionally trip the breaker. The list goes on.</p><p>I voiced some of these concerns to employer last Thursday. He fired me without providing any reason yesterday. I am assuming it was in connection to my complaint as he would not provide me any other reason.</p><p>Do I go to OSHA?

That being said, from personal experience, OSHA has a very hard time investigating a report by one employee after said employee has been fired. I was told by the OSHA rep I dealt with regarding a previous job that it was a problem because they get a lot of false reports made by business competitors. The rules and regulations governing what they can do are also different regarding employees reporting actively dangerous environments in which they are <em>currently</em> working and former employees reporting unsafe conditions during the time of their employment.</p><p>If you are able to identify any of the chemicals you worked around, and whether they are considered hazardous (and how hazardous), OSHA may be able to do more. Depending on the chemicals and their handling at the company, you may also be able to make a report to your state environmental regulations/protection office.</p></div></div></div><div class="answerrowex"><div class="panel"><h6>1. Which piece of advice is better (more helpful <i>overall</i>)? <label class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Definitely B</label></h6> <p>Advice B is on-topic, telling the question-asker about OSHA and offering a suggestion about what to note in the report.

Jane is elderly and has memory problems. Jane claims she has had a safe deposit box for several decades. She has a key for it that is labeled with a box number, but she cannot find any bank statements or other financial records that mention it. She says it was originally part of her bank's promotional package deal with new accounts in which a safe deposit box was included with no additional charge, so there have never been any payments for it (nor records of payments for it). We went to Jane's bank and they say they do not have any record of her currently having a box. A manager said they would conduct a more thorough investigation and then days later reported to us that they are confident that she does not have a safe deposit box with them.</p><p>The bank went through several mergers, acquisitions, changes of names, etc. over the decades that Jane has been banking with them. I am speculating at this point that through these business reorganizations, the free safe deposit box deal expired (or was forgotten) and records of it are no longer accessible; and then the box was never paid for, and then it was considered abandoned. I am also considering that Jane has simply misremembered which bank/branch the box is physically located in and has forgotten other locations where she may have banked over the years.</p><p>She is located in Pennsylvania as are all the potential bank branches involved. I have checked the Pennsylvania Treasury's Unclaimed Property website but a search on her name there turns up nothing. I don't know where to go from here.</p><p>My questions are:</p><ol><li>If the box were considered abandoned, legally could the fate of its contents be anywhere other than turned over to the state government?</li><li>Would there be any other government record of it beyond the Pennsylvania Treasury's Unclaimed Property website?</li><li>If the box is still in existence and we just don't know where, is there any way of finding out where it is?</li><li>Would a lawyer be able to help, and if so what type of lawyer?  (The financial and sentimental value of the items in the box may be substantial, so we are willing to spend the money on a lawyer if it will help.)</li></ol></div><div class="row"><div class="col-xl-6"><div class="panel"><h6><i>Advice A</i></h6><p>Not a lawyer, but did you search eith her maiden name as well as her married name, and her husband's name?
